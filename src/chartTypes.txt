Basic chart types:

Bar chart: Represents data as horizontal or vertical bars, with lengths proportional to the data values.
Line chart: Displays data points connected by lines, typically used to show trends over time.
Area chart: Similar to line charts, but with the area between the line and axis filled, emphasizing the volume or magnitude.
Pie chart: Displays data as segments of a circle, representing proportions of the whole.
Scatter plot: Displays data as individual points in a Cartesian coordinate system, representing the relationship between two variables.
Donut chart: Similar to pie charts, but with a hole in the center, emphasizing the proportions rather than exact values.
Bubble chart: A variation of a scatter plot, where data points are represented as bubbles with sizes proportional to an additional variable.

Hierarchical and tree-based charts:

Treemap: Displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles, with sizes proportional to the data values.
Sunburst: Represents hierarchical data as concentric rings, with each layer representing a level in the hierarchy.
Tree diagram: Visualizes hierarchical data as nodes connected by links, representing parent-child relationships.
Cluster diagram: Similar to tree diagrams, but with a focus on grouping related nodes together.
Pack layout: Displays hierarchical data as nested circles, with sizes proportional to the data values.

Network and graph-based charts:

Force-directed graph: Displays nodes and links in a network, using physical simulation to determine the layout and position.
Chord diagram: Visualizes relationships between entities in a circular layout, with arcs representing connections.
Sankey diagram: Displays flow quantities between nodes in a network, with link widths proportional to the flow values.
Arc diagram: Represents nodes and links in a linear layout, with arcs representing connections between nodes.

Geographical and map-based charts:

Choropleth map: Displays geographical regions colored according to data values.
Heatmap: Represents data as a matrix of colored cells, with colors representing data values.
Point map: Displays data points on a geographic map, often using size or color to represent additional variables.
Line map: Visualizes paths or routes on a geographic map, often used for transportation or migration data.
Hexbin map: Aggregates data points into hexagonal bins, with colors or heights representing aggregated values.
Statistical and specialized charts:

Histogram: Displays the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing it into bins and representing the counts as bars.
Box plot: Visualizes the distribution of a variable using quartiles, whiskers, and outliers.
Violin plot: Combines aspects of box plots and kernel density plots, displaying the distribution of a variable using smoothed curves.
Parallel coordinates: Represents multivariate data as lines connecting parallel axes, with each axis representing a variable.
Radar chart: Displays multivariate data on multiple axes originating from the same point, with lines connecting the data points.
Streamgraph: A variation of stacked area charts, with flowing shapes representing data values over time.
