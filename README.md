## Nomenclature

Within the current context of this repo:

* `graph` refers to the graph **data structure**, such as nodes pointing to nodes
* `chart` refers to visualized data
* hypothetically speaking, a `graph chart` is a type of chart, unrelated to the `graph` data structure

For simplification, the above is likely to be changed at some point.
